                Sylhet is one of the oldest cities in Bangladesh having a vast historical and cultural background. 
                It is a city in eastern Bangladesh, on the Surma River. It's known for its Sufi shrines, like the
                 ornate tomb and mosque of 14th-century saint Hazrat Shah Jalal, now a major pilgrimage site near 
                 Dargah Gate. The tiny Museum of Rajas contains the belongings of the local folk poet Hasan Raja.
                  A 3-domed gateway stands at the 17th-century Shahi Eidgah, a huge open-air hilltop mosque built
                   by Emperor Aurangzeb. Sylhet tour is your perfect holiday destination during the monsoon and
